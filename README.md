SALES REPORTING MANAGEMENT TOOL
THE JOURNEY
Sales reporting management tool is an application that is used by 
people who are in sales to report their figures for the day.
The application is aimed at simplyfying the sales person journey,
the analyst plus the organiztion that uses the application through
real time reporting, instant update of the figures on the dashboard
among other benefits.
I was challenged to come up with the tool after visiting one of the
institutions and was shocked that they were reporting their sales 
manually in this era of being digital to the core.
The application receives data from the sales team from different regions.
The application at the end of the day closes shifts by data analysis of 
the sales profit margin, the gaps that need to be addressed from the 
sales report and overall interpretation of the data fed. 
Users are created and the users who fail to log in are deactivated 
for control purposes and data protection of the institutions that 
use the application. Users have an option of giving feedback, 
opinions, compliments and even complaints through this application.
The application requires maintenance from time to time to ensure 
99.9% uptime for smooth flow of data.
